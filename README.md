# Fractal_comp-decomp
A code of compressing file size and decompressing file size

This Java program demonstrates file compression and decompression using the Deflate algorithm, structured with an interface-based design. It reads a .txt file into a byte array, compresses it using a class that implements a Compressor interface, then decompresses it back to its original form. The program compares the original and decompressed data to verify accuracy and displays the byte sizes before and after compression. Using an interface allows the compression logic to be abstracted, making the code flexible, modular, and easily extendable for future compression algorithms.
